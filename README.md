# COVEN: A Suite Of VAMPIRE Models 

COVEN (**C**ollection **O**f **V**AMPIRE models for **E**nhanced **N**otifications) is a suite of VAMPIRE models, predicting if the maximum daily 1.8MeV Electron Flux or daily 1.8MeV Electron Fluence will exceed a threshold set at their respective 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th and 95th Percentiles.

The model uses a random forest methodology and uses selected inputs from the OMNI dataset, with the flux measurements from Van Allen Probe,

Within the Example Notebooks folder there is an example python notebook for a suite of VAMPIRE-X models. This notebook downloads datasets from https://zenodo.org/records/18495889 , and trains and tests each model.

Each Notebook will import each of the required package versions.
